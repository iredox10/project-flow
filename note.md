  1. Enhanced Dashboard and Analytics

  Your dashboard pages (StudentDashboard.jsx, SupervisorDashboard.jsx, etc.) are
  perfect places to surface more at-a-glance information.

   * Student Dashboard:
       * Progress Visualization: Add a progress bar for the entire project (e.g., "3
         of 5 chapters completed").
       * Recent Activity Feed: Show recent comments from the supervisor or upcoming
         deadlines.
   * Supervisor/Admin Dashboard:
       * Key Metrics: Display cards with key statistics like "Projects Awaiting
         Review," "Active Students," or "Recently Completed Projects."
       * Supervisor Workload: For Admins, a view showing how many students are
         assigned to each supervisor could help with balancing assignments.

  2. Improved Communication and Collaboration

   * Email Notifications: While in-app notifications are great, users often rely on
     email. You could use Firebase Functions to trigger emails for critical events:
       * A supervisor leaves a new comment.
       * A student submits a chapter for review.
       * An admin assigns a student to a supervisor.
   * Project-wide Announcements: Allow supervisors or admins to post announcements
     that are visible to all students associated with a project or across the entire
     system.

  3. Advanced Project Management Features

   * Deadline and Milestone Tracking:
       * Integrate a calendar or a timeline view where supervisors can set deadlines
         for proposals, chapters, and final submissions.
       * This would provide a clear roadmap for students and help supervisors track
         progress across all their projects.
   * File Management:
       * Add a dedicated section within a project for uploading and managing
         supplementary files like datasets, PDFs of research papers, or presentations.
         Each project could have its own simple file repository.
   * Project Templates:
       * Allow Admins or Supervisors to create project templates (e.g., "Final Year
         Project," "Master's Thesis") with a predefined set of chapters and initial
         instructions. This would standardize the process and make project setup
         quicker.

  A good starting point could be enhancing the Dashboards. The data likely already
  exists in Firestore, and surfacing it effectively would immediately improve the
  user experience for all roles without requiring major architectural changes.
